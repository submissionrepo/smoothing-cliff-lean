# Expectations for finite distributions

This file defines expectation and variance for `FinDist` and proves basic algebraic rules.

## Main definitions

* `FinDist.expect`: Expectation as a finite sum.
* `FinDist.variance`: Variance of a real-valued function.

## Main statements

* `FinDist.expect_add`: Additivity of expectation.
* `FinDist.expect_mixture`: Expectation of a finite mixture.
* `FinDist.variance_nonneg`: Nonnegativity of variance.
