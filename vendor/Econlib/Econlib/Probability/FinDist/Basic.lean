# `FinDist α` — probability distribution over a finite type

The structure `FinDist α` is a probability mass function over any `[Fintype α] [DecidableEq α]`;
distributions over `Fin n` are `FinDist (Fin n)`. The nonnegativity and sum-to-one constraints are
baked into the type as fields, so every `FinDist` is a valid distribution by construction. This
file collects the core API together with the elementary constructors: The Dirac point mass `pure`,
the `uniform` distribution, the binary `mixture`, and the finite `finMixture`.

## Main definitions

* `FinDist` — a pmf `α → ℝ` that is nonnegative and sums to one.
* `FinDist.support` — the set of outcomes with positive probability.
* `FinDist.IsMode` — the probability mass is maximized at an outcome.
* `FinDist.pure` — point mass at a single outcome.
* `FinDist.uniform` — the uniform distribution on a nonempty finite type.
* `FinDist.mixture` — convex combination of two distributions.
* `FinDist.finMixture` — finite mixture indexed by a finite type.

## Main statements

* `FinDist.prob_le_one` — each probability is at most one.
* `FinDist.support_mixture` — support of a strict mixture is the union of supports.
