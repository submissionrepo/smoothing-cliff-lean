# Discrete approximation of real-valued probability laws in convex order

To prove the hard direction of **Strassen's theorem**, a pair of laws `μ ≼cx[a,b] ν` is
approximated by a sequence of finitely-supported pairs `μₙ ≼cx νₙ` whose embedded laws converge
weakly to `μ` and `ν`. The approximating construction is **conditional-mean atomization**:
Partition the unit interval of quantile levels into `n` equal bins, place the `k`-th atom at the
bin-conditional mean of the quantile function, and weight each atom by `1/n`. This preserves means
exactly and preserves convex order via the Hardy–Littlewood–Pólya integrated-quantile
characterization.

## Main statements

* `exists_discrete_approximation` — given `μ ≼cx[a,b] ν`, there is a sequence
  `(pₙ, qₙ) : ℕ → DiscreteLaw × DiscreteLaw` with `pₙ.ConvexOrder qₙ`, both supported on `Icc a b`,
  and `pₙ.toProbDist → μ`, `qₙ.toProbDist → ν` weakly.

## Notes

The conditional-mean atomization and its convex-order and convergence properties are developed in
`Strassen/CondMeanAtom/`; the discrete case `DiscreteLaw.exists_martingaleCoupling_uniform` is in
`Strassen/Discrete.lean`.
