# Measure-theoretic probability distributions

`ProbDist α` is an abbreviation for Mathlib's `ProbabilityMeasure α`. It is the unifying type that
sees finite, countable, continuous, and singular laws through one measure-theoretic interface, and
carries the weak-* topology that concrete types (`FinDist`, `ContDist`) lack.

Consumers that need only `∑` or `∫` over a fixed type should use `FinDist`, `ContDist`, or
`CountDist` directly; `ProbDist` is for type-polymorphic code, topology on distributions, and
cross-type composition. This file provides the core operations: Expectation, the Dirac point mass,
pushforward along a measurable map, and the independent product.

## Main definitions

* `ProbDist α` — abbreviation for `ProbabilityMeasure α`.
* `ProbDist.expect` — expected value `∫ x, f x ∂d.toMeasure`.
* `ProbDist.dirac` — point mass at a point.
* `ProbDist.map` — pushforward along a measurable map.
* `ProbDist.prod` — independent product coupling.

## Main statements

* `ProbDist.expect_lt`, `ProbDist.lt_expect` — strict expectation bounds.
* `ProbDist.expect_map` — change of variables for pushforward expectation.

/-! ### Expectation -/

/-- Expected value of `f` under `d`.

This is Mathlib's (Bochner) integral `∫ x, f x ∂d.toMeasure`, hence **totalized**: It equals the
mathematical expectation `E_d[f]` exactly when `f` is `Integrable d.toMeasure`, and silently
returns `0` when it is not (the convention of `MeasureTheory.integral`). Linearity and order laws
that fail without integrability carry the corresponding `Integrable` hypotheses, which is where the
contract is discharged. -/
