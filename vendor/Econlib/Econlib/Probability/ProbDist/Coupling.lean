# Couplings of probability laws

A **coupling** of laws `μ : ProbDist α` and `ν : ProbDist β` is a joint law `π : ProbDist (α × β)`
whose `Prod.fst`-marginal is `μ` and whose `Prod.snd`-marginal is `ν`. Every pair `(μ, ν)` admits
at least one coupling — the independent product `ProbDist.prod μ ν` — so the set of couplings is
always nonempty.

## Main definitions

* `IsCoupling μ ν π` — `π : ProbDist (α × β)` has first marginal `μ` and second marginal `ν`.

## Main statements

* `ProbDist.prod_isCoupling` — the independent product is a coupling of its factors.
* `exists_coupling` — every pair of laws admits a coupling.
* `IsCoupling.supportsOn_prod_set` — a coupling of laws supported on `s` and `t` is supported on
  `s ×ˢ t`.
