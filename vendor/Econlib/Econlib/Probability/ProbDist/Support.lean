# Support of a `ProbDist`

`d.supportsOn s` records that `s` carries probability one under `d`. The predicate is generic over
the measurable space; the lemmas below specialize to `ℝ`, where the order and `Icc` structure are
used to derive integrability of continuous statistics on a compact-interval support and membership
of the mean in that interval.

## Main definitions

* `ProbDist.supportsOn` — the predicate `d.toMeasure s = 1`, generic over the measurable space.

## Main statements

* `ProbDist.ae_mem_of_supportsOn`, `ProbDist.supportsOn_of_ae_mem` — support is equivalent to
  almost-everywhere membership.
* `ProbDist.supportsOn_map`, `ProbDist.supportsOn_mono`, `ProbDist.supportsOn_dirac`,
  `ProbDist.supportsOn_finMixture` — closure of support under pushforward, widening, Dirac masses,
  and finite mixtures.
* `ProbDist.integrable_of_supportsOn_Icc`, `ProbDist.expect_mem_Icc` — integrability and mean
  bounds for a law supported on a compact interval.
