# Weak-* topology on `ProbDist`: Tightness, weak-limit extraction, marginal continuity

Generic facts about the weak-* topology on `ProbDist α = ProbabilityMeasure α`, isolated from any
order / Strassen / persuasion context. Three families:

* a sequence of probability measures concentrated on a fixed compact square is automatically
  **tight**, and **Prokhorov**'s theorem gives sequential compactness of the closure;
* marginal pushforward maps `π ↦ π.map Prod.fst` / `Prod.snd` are weak-* continuous;
* a weak limit of couplings is a coupling of the limit marginals, by uniqueness of weak limits.

## Main statements

* `isTight_of_supportsOn_Icc_prod` — `Icc a b × Icc a b`-supported sequences are tight.
* `exists_weak_limit_of_supportsOn_Icc_prod` — extract a weak-limit subsequence with the same
  compact support.
* `ProbabilityMeasure.continuous_map_fst`, `continuous_map_snd` — marginal pushforward continuity.
* `IsCoupling.of_weak_limit` — the coupling property is preserved at weak limits.
